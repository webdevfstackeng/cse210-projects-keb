1 Nephi 3:2-3 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold I have dreamed a  dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem. For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a genealogy of my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of brass.
